# LibLrc
A easy Java library to read .lrc files.

# Build
Just build with java command prompt.

# Use
Download the .jar file and put it in build path. Use `LibLrc.load()` function to load stuff.

# Test
I provided a test program at `test.hhs.xgn.liblrc.Test` .This program needs jl1.0.jar to run. But the library doesn't need any external libraries.
